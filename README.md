Options:
--remote-folder-prefix - Doesn't exist yet. If there is sufficient interest I can add one or accept a pull request. This would accept a folder where the files are kept in the remote repository, in case that the local repo has the files in the root, while the remote repo has the files in a subdirectory with a different name.
